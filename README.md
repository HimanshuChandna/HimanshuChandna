## Current Focus

I am developing **Atmos-AQ**, a consumer-grade air quality monitoring device.

The project covers the complete product lifecycle:
- PCB design from scratch
- Sensor integration and power design
- Bare-metal firmware and hardware interfaces
- Enclosure design using Fusion 360 and functional 3D printing

## Technical Domains

| Area | Competencies |
|-----|-------------|
| Embedded Systems | C / C++, Bare-metal firmware, MCU peripherals, I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO |
| Hardware Design | Schematic capture, PCB layout, Power design, Component selection, BOM |
| Mechanical Design | Fusion 360, Functional 3D printing, Enclosure design |
| Engineering Tools | Git & GitHub, Debugging and testing tools |

## Featured Projects

### 🌫️ Atmos-AQ — Air Quality Monitoring Device
A consumer-focused air quality monitoring system designed for indoor environments.

- Custom PCB with sensor and power sections
- Bare-metal firmware architecture
- Modular hardware interfaces
- Designed for enclosure integration

## Engineering Approach

I focus on building reliable, maintainable systems by designing hardware and firmware together, keeping architectures simple, and prioritizing real-world performance and reliability.
